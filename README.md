# Personal Website

Hi! This is the very first draft of my personal website. It contains very simple information. I am hoping to add more things to it, including projects, blogs, and other random things! 

The page contains a toggle allowing for switching between light and dark mode. Currently working on adding a navigation bar at the top, and a contact form at the bottom, as well as more features!
